# GitHub Portfolio
## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and contributions within the GitHub ecosystem. As a software developer, I have chosen GitHub as the focal point of my portfolio for several reasons.

GitHub is not just a platform for version control; it's a thriving community of developers, designers, and enthusiasts collaborating on projects of all sizes and types. Its impact on the software development landscape is profound, offering a centralized hub for code sharing, collaboration, and innovation.

## Why GitHub?
I selected GitHub as the domain for my portfolio because of its significance in modern software development. GitHub provides a versatile platform for version control, project management, and collaboration, making it an essential tool for developers worldwide.

GitHub's vast community and extensive features make it an exciting domain to explore and contribute to. Whether it's developing personal projects, collaborating on open-source initiatives, or showcasing skills through contributions, GitHub offers endless opportunities for growth and learning.

## GitHub Functionalities
GitHub offers a comprehensive suite of services and features tailored to the needs of developers and teams. Some of the key services provided by GitHub include:

### Version Control

GitHub is built on top of Git, which uses various algorithms for efficient version control.

- **SHA-1 Hashing**: Used to uniquely identify commits.
  - **Algorithm**: SHA-1
  - **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the input.

- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Represents the commit history.
  - **Algorithm**: Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the DAG.
  - **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices (commits) and E is the number of edges (parent-child relationships).
**[More details](./Functionalities/Version_Control.md)**
### Diff Algorithms

GitHub uses diff algorithms to show changes between file versions.

- **Myers Diff Algorithm**: Computes the differences between two files.
  - **Algorithm**: Myers Diff Algorithm
  - **Time Complexity**: O(nd) where n and d are the lengths of the two files.

**[More details](./Functionalities/Diff.md)**

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions enable continuous integration and continuous deployment.

- **Dependency Graph**: Identifies dependencies between jobs to determine the correct execution order.
  - **Algorithm**: Topological Sorting
  - **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)

- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Ensures efficient and timely execution of CI/CD pipelines.
  - **Algorithm**: Job Scheduling Algorithms (e.g., Priority Scheduling)
  - **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) where n is the number of jobs.

### Search Functionality

GitHub's search functionality allows users to search within documentation and repositories.

- **Full-Text Search**: Searches within documentation and repositories.
  - **Algorithm**: Inverted Index
  - **Time Complexity**:
    - Indexing: O(n log n) where n is the number of documents.
    - Querying: O(k + log n) where k is the number of query terms.

- **Trie for Prefix Search**: Supports efficient prefix-based search and autocomplete.
  - **Algorithm**: Trie (Prefix Tree)
  - **Time Complexity**:
    - Insertion: O(m) where m is the length of the key.
    - Search: O(m) where m is the length of the key.

### Recommendation Algorithms

GitHub suggests repositories, contributors, and projects based on user behavior and interests.

- **Recommendation Systems**: Uses collaborative filtering to make recommendations.
  - **Algorithm**: Collaborative Filtering
  - **Time Complexity**:
    - User-Item Matrix Construction: O(m * n) where m is the number of users and n is the number of items.
    - Recommendation: O(k * log n) where k is the number of recommendations.

### Rate Limiting

GitHub manages the number of API requests per user to ensure fair usage.

- **API Request Limits**: Uses rate limiting algorithms to manage requests.
  - **Algorithm**: Token Bucket or Leaky Bucket
  - **Time Complexity**: O(1) per request.

**[More details](./Functionalities/Rate_Limiting.md)**

### Project Management and Collaboration

GitHub provides robust project management tools to help teams plan, track, and manage their work.

- **Kanban Boards**: Visual project management tool.
  - **Algorithm**: Simple List Sorting
  - **Time Complexity**: O(n*logn)

- **Milestones and Issues**: Track progress and manage project timelines.
  - **Algorithm**: Prioritization Algorithms
  - **Time Complexity**: O(n)

### Insights and Analytics

GitHub offers insights and analytics to help businesses understand their codebase and development processes.

- **Commit Activity**: Analyzes commit frequency and patterns.
  - **Algorithm**: Time Series Analysis
  - **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)

**[More details](./Functionalities/Insights_Analytics.md)**

### Open Source Contributions

Enhance innovation and reduce costs by leveraging and contributing to public repositories.

- **Fork and Pull Request Management**: Manages contributions.
  - **Algorithm**: Fork-Join
  - **Time Complexity**: O(n)

**[More details](./Functionalities/open_source.md)**

### Notifications in GitHub
GitHub provides notifications to keep users informed about updates and changes in their repositories.

- **Email and Web Notifications**: Alerts users about activity such as new issues, pull requests, and comments.
  - **Algorithm**: Event Handling and Dispatch
  - **Time Complexity**: O(1) per event
